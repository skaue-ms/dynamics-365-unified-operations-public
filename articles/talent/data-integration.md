# Data integration guidance for Dynamics 365 for Talent

[!include[banner](../includes/banner.md)]


## Overview
Dynamics 365 for Talent manages business data that is useful in a variety of
business processes. This topic provides guidance on various options for
integrating with data managed by Dynamics 365 for Talent, describing the
characteristics of different integration technologies so that integrators can
make informed decisions regarding which technologies best fit their needs.

## Data integration vision
Microsoft sees business data as a key asset that makes your company unique. Your
business’s data is highly valuable. Data gathered and maintained by one part of
the business relates to data gathered by another part of the business, and these
relations can be used to improve business processes and business intelligence
across your organization. Providing easy, secure, stable access to your business
data, regardless of which system “owns” the data is a key tenet to the vision we
have for data integration with Dynamics 365 for Talent.

Historically, integrating data between multiple systems has been difficult.
Microsoft is taking steps to make data integration easier, and a large step
toward that goal is realized through [Common Data Service (CDS) for
Apps](https://docs.microsoft.com/powerapps/maker/common-data-service/data-platform-intro).
Going forward, Dynamics 365 for Talent is making CDS for Apps the preferred
public interface for Talent data. Over time, we expect that all the most important
data managed by Dynamics 365 for Talent will be exposed in CDS. We recommend CDS
as the technology of choice for most integrating applications. While we realize
that not all data your application may require is currently present in CDS, and
that your project timelines may require an alternative technology, please
let us know when CDS does not meet your integration needs.

## Integration technologies
The following sections describe the different data integration technologies
available for use with Dynamics 365 for Talent (Core HR).

### CDS entities
CDS is the preferred public data interface for Dynamics 365 for Talent. CDS is
built on a mature platform, having grown out of the Dynamics 365 “XRM” platform,
upon which the [Dynamics 365 Customer
Engagement](https://docs.microsoft.com/dynamics365/#pivot=business-apps&panel=customer-engagement)
solutions are built.

CDS provides a platform for data entities and an API for accessing those
entities. When Dynamics 365 for Talent is deployed in your organization, Talent
is connected to a CDS instance and the entities that maintain Talent data are
deployed into that CDS instance, making the entities and their data available to
any application that can connect to the CDS instance. Depending on which Talent
apps you are using, Talent either performs data operations directly against the
CDS entities (this is the case for Attract and Onboard) or synchronizes data
to/from the CDS entities (this is the case for Core HR).

Once the data entities that expose the data your integrating apps require are
present in CDS, you can make full use of the [CDS platform and the APIs it
supports](https://docs.microsoft.com/powerapps/#pivot=home&panel=developer).
Among the supported APIs is the [Dynamics 365 Web
API](https://docs.microsoft.com/previous-versions/dynamicscrm-2016/developers-guide/mt593051(v=crm.8)),
which provides an OData implementation for accessing CDS data.

The CDS entities and the associated APIs are the best option for accessing
Talent data from web applications, web services/APIs, and from any other
application that connects to OData feeds.

> [!NOTE]
> With the decision to make CDS for Apps the preferred data interface for
Talent (Core HR) being relatively recent, you may find that the Core HR data
entities you need for your integration are not yet available in CDS\*. If the
Core HR entities required for your integration are not yet available, you will
need to wait for the data entities to be made available or you will need to use
one of the other integration technologies described below.



### DMF/DIXF entities
Dynamics 365 for Talent (Core HR), built primarily on the same platform as
Dynamics 365 for Finance and Operations, provides a [Data Management Framework
(DMF)](https://docs.microsoft.com/dynamics365/unified-operations/dev-itpro/data-entities/data-entities-data-packages?toc=/fin-and-ops/toc.json), sometimes also known as the Data Import Export Framework or
DIXF, and a set of data entities that can be used for importing/exporting data
into/from Talent. While CDS entities are the preferred data integration
interface for Talent, the DMF entities will still be useful in some
circumstances, such as:

- CDS entities are not yet available.

- The integration requires high performance bulk data import/export capabilities.

The DMF entities currently provide the most complete data coverage for Talent
(Core HR) data.

DMF is not appropriate for real-time integrations (such as when immediate user
feedback in a user interface is required), because package operations are
scheduled batch jobs, and will often have a minimum of a 1-2 minute latency
before the batch service picks up the job for execution, plus whatever time is
required to complete the import/export operation.

DMF may be the best option when high throughput is required (such as a nightly
scheduled import/export of many thousands of records).

> [!NOTE]
> DMF is not available for Attract and Onboard.

### DMF package REST API

The DMF provides a [REST
API](https://docs.microsoft.com/dynamics365/unified-operations/dev-itpro/data-entities/data-management-api)
for manipulating data packages. This API can be used to programmatically
interact with the DMF, allowing actions such as:

- Importing a data package.

- Exporting a data package.

- Checking the status of an import/export operation.

The DMF Package REST API is fully supported in Dynamics 365 for Talent (Core
HR).

### Azure SQL DB (BYOD)

DMF additionally provides a powerful feature (generally known as [Bring Your Own
Database](https://docs.microsoft.com/dynamics365/unified-operations/dev-itpro/analytics/export-entities-to-your-own-database),
or BYOD) that allows Talent to export data to your own Microsoft Azure SQL
database. This provides tremendous flexibility, because when the data is present
in your own SQL database, you can make use of any applications or middleware
that can connect to a SQL datastore.

BYOD should generally be considered a read-only solution. While you are able to
manipulate and store whatever data you want in the Azure SQL database (such as for
data mashups), data stored in the Azure SQL database will not be synchronized
back to Talent Core HR.

BYOD is appropriate for reporting solutions, data integrations, data mashups, as
a data source for an [Azure Data
Factory](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/data-factory/) pipeline.

> [!NOTE]
> BYOD is not available for Attract and Onboard.

### OData-enabled entities
Most DMF entities are also enabled for access through the Talent data service
(OData). The documentation provided for the [Finance and Operations OData
service](https://docs.microsoft.com/dynamics365/unified-operations/dev-itpro/data-entities/odata)
generally also applies to Talent (Core HR), although documentation about
creating your own OData-exposed entities will not apply.

While CDS and the OData implementation provided by CDS (through the [Dynamics
365 Web
API](https://docs.microsoft.com/previous-versions/dynamicscrm-2016/developers-guide/mt593051(v=crm.8)))
is preferred over the Talent data service, the Talent data service currently has
more complete entity coverage for the Talent data.

### Excel Add-in

The [Excel
Add-in](https://docs.microsoft.com/dynamics365/unified-operations/dev-itpro/office-integration/use-excel-add-in?toc=/dynamics365/unified-operations/talent/toc.json)
makes use of OData-enabled entities beneath the surface. It provides a
convenient way for an end user to retrieve and modify Talent data through the
familiar Excel UI.

The Excel Add-in is appropriate for ad-hoc data imports/exports by business
domain experts. For a recurring data integration that requires programmatic
automation, another integration technology will be more appropriate.

### Data Integrator
The CDS for Apps administrator experience provides a [Data Integrator
service](https://docs.microsoft.com/powerapps/administrator/data-integrator)
that can be used for data integrations to/from CDS. Data Integrator can be used
to define integration projects (often based on pre-defined templates that
application developers have tailored for specific integrations). The integration
projects can be scheduled to run automatically on a recurring schedule or be run
manually.

Data Integrator projects are appropriate for CDS-based batch integrations and
make a great choice for integrations between the Dynamics 365 family of
applications. As an example, Microsoft provides an out-of-the-box Data
Integrator template that can be used for integrating data from Dynamics 365 for
Talent (Core HR) into Dynamics 365 for Finance and Operations. For more information, see [Integration from Dynamics 365 for Talent to Dynamics 365 for Finance and Operations](talent-financeandoperations-integration.md).

### Power Query

Data Integrator also supports [Power
Query](https://docs.microsoft.com/power-query/power-query-what-is-power-query)
(through its [Advanced Query
feature](https://docs.microsoft.com/powerapps/administrator/data-integrator#advanced-data-transformation-and-filtering)).
Power Query provides powerful, flexible data filtering and transformation,
including the rich M formula language, and will likely be familiar to those who
have experience developing Power BI reports.

## Deciding on an integration technology
With so many different integration technologies available, deciding on which
integration approach to use can sometimes be overwhelming. Over time,
and particularly as the data coverage in CDS matures, the decision will become
easier, with CDS being the preferred data interface in most cases. But until
then, you may find that CDS does not yet meet your needs. The following table
helps summarize some of the key characteristics of the various integration
technology options.

| Technology/Tool/API    | Recurring integrations                   | Synchronous/Asynchronous                    | Programmatic access through an API        | Appropriate data volumes                                   | Data coverage                       |

| BYOD                   | Yes, scheduled by Admin in Talent        | Async, Batch                                | No\*\*\*                                    | High (hundreds of thousands of records)                    | Supports all DMF entities           |
| OData-enabled entities | Yes, using middleware                    | Sync                                        | Yes, through Talent Data Service (OData)  | Varies with use case (supports paging for interactive use) | High                                |
| Excel Add-in           | No                                       | Sync                                        | No                                        | Medium (tens of thousands of records)                      | Supports all OData-enabled entities |
| Data Integrator        | Yes, scheduled in Data Integrator        | Async, Batch                                | No                                        | Varies with use case                                       | Supports all CDS entities           |


## Summary
Your business data is a valuable asset, but its value can be greatly diminished
if it is hard to use the data for your specific purposes (such as reporting, data
mashups, or custom applications). Dynamics 365 for Talent provides several
technologies for working with your data outside of the Talent application’s user interface (UI),
allowing integrating applications access to the data. This topic has described
the available integration technologies and some of their key characteristics.
This information should help you make better decisions on which approaches to
leverage for your integration projects.

entities, and recommends CDS as the preferred data interface when coverage is
available. Currently, CDS data coverage is low relative to DMF
and OData-enabled entities.
