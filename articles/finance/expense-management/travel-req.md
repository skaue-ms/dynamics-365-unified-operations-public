# Travel requisitions

[!include [banner](../includes/banner.md)]

A *travel requisition* is a source document that lists the expenses that will be incurred for the purpose of travel. A travel requisition is submitted for review and can then be used to authorize expenses.

Your organization might require that a travel requisition be submitted before employees incur any expense that is charged to the organization. This requirement applies, regardless of whether employees charge expenses to a corporate credit card, spend cash that they received from a cash advance, or incur out-of-pocket expenses that will be reimbursed by the organization.

Travel requisitions and policies can be used to help with budget control. For example, if your organization is working on a fixed-price project that requires travel, the travel expenses of the project's team members must fit within the budget for the project. By requiring that travel expenses be approved before they are incurred, the organization can help make sure that the project remains within budget.

You can set up policies for travel requisitions from the **Travel requisition** page.
