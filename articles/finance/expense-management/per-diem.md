# Per diem rules

[!include [banner](../includes/banner.md)]

A *per diem* is an allowance that is paid to a worker who is traveling for work. In Expense management, you can create per diem rules for 
various travel situations. Per diem rates can be based on the time of year, the travel location, or both. When you create a per diem 
rule, you can specify that a percentage of the per diem rate will be withheld if a worker receives complimentary meals or services. You can
also set a minimum and maximum number of hours that the per diem rate can apply to a worker's travel.

The calculation of a total per diem amount is based on the start dates and end dates that you can set on the **Per diems** page.
