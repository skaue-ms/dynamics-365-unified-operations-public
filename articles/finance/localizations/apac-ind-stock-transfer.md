# Stock transfers for India

[!include [banner](../includes/banner.md)]

You can use transfer orders to process inventory transfers between warehouses. In India, when an item is shipped from a warehouse and is in transit to another warehouse, its value should be posted to a **Goods in transit** account. Additionally, if the shipping and receiving branches of the organization have different tax registration numbers, the India Goods and Services Tax (GST) should be calculated and posted for the transfer. After the item is registered at the receiving warehouse, the item value should be written off from the **Goods in transit** account and posted to the **Inventory** account. This will combine the **Inventory** account and the **Goods in transit** account to create the total inventory balance. The GST payable amount that was posted for the transfer shipment should be posted to GST recoverable upon the transfer receipt. If an item is shipped at a higher price than its cost price, the difference between the cost price and the transfer price, along with the GST amount, is added to an **Interim transit** account, which also should be nullified when the transfer receipt is registered. If some items appear to be missing or damaged when registering them in the receiving warehouse, the scrap quantity can be registered. The value of the scrapped items will be posted to inventory loss with the reduction of the inventory value and the reversal of the tax credit. 

The **Stock transfer** functionality that is available for India supports this process.

## Set up stock transfers

### Configure transfer pricing

You can configure the prices that will be used when processing stock transfers for an item. To do this, on the **Released product details** page open the **Transfer price** page.

### Configure stock transfer posting

You can configure the posting accounts for stock transfers in the **Inventory management** module on the **Transfer order** tab on the **Posting** page. 

### Configure Master planning parameters

You can define a default transfer order type and a default price type for transfer orders that are created when confirming planned orders in the **Master planning** module. On the **Master planning parameters** page, on the **Standard update** tab, select **Transfer type** and **Price type** in the **Firm - Transfer** group.

## Create and post a stock transfer order

1. Go to **Inventory management** > **Outbound orders** > **Transfer order** and create a new transfer order.
2. In the **From warehouse** field, select the supply warehouse that the items are dispatched from.
3. In the **To warehouse** field, select the receiving warehouse that the items are delivered to.
4. In the **Transfer type** field, select **Stock transfer** to apply taxes to the transfer of items.
    

    > [!NOTE]
    > If you select **Transfer order** in the **Transfer type** field, the transfer order will be posted based on the standard transfer order process.

5. On the **Transfer order lines** tab, create a new line and in the **Item number** field, select the item to transfer.
6. In the **Transfer quantity** field, enter the quantity of the items to transfer, and in the **Unit** field, modify the default unit of measurement, if required.
7. In the **Price type** field, select the price type for the transaction, from the following options:
    
    - **Cost price** – The cost price, or the on-hand price, of the item is used for the transaction.
    - **Transfer price** – The transfer price that is set up for the item is used for the transaction.
    
    > [!NOTE]
    > If the **Price type** is set to **Transfer price**, the quantity of the items that are defined for the combination of item and dimension on the **Transfer price** page is displayed in the **Transfer quantity** field, but it can be modified.

8. In the **Unit price** field, enter the cost price or the transfer price for one unit of the item.
9. On the **Financial dimensions** tab, select the values of the financial dimensions for the transfer order. 

    > [!NOTE]
    > If the link between the **Site** inventory dimension and a financial dimension is configured and activated on the **Dimension link** page, the value of the financial dimension that is linked to **Site** is populated from the site that the **From warehouse** belongs to.

10. Select the **Tax information** tab to set up taxes for the transaction, and enter details. You can change the default information that is displayed in the fields.
11. Select **Ship** > **Ship transfer order**, and on the **Shipment** page, post the transfer order shipment.
12. Select **Receive** > **Receive**, and on the **Receive** page, post the transfer order receipt.
