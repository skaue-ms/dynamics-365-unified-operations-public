# Regulatory updates

[!include [banner](../includes/banner.md)]

This topic lists the regulatory updates that are planned for release in Microsoft Dynamics 365 for Finance and Operations supported localizations. Delivery timelines might change, and projected functionality might change or might not be released. Read [Microsoft policy](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=2007332) for more information. 

Regulatory updates are different than regulatory features. To learn about planned or released regulatory features, refer to the following resources.

- [Dynamics 365 and Power Platform Release Notes](https://docs.microsoft.com/business-applications-release-notes/index)
- [What's new for Microsoft Dynamics 365 for Finance and Operations](../../fin-and-ops/get-started/whats-new-changed.md)

When a month is used in the Date column, the regulatory update is planned to be delivered sometime within that month. The delivery date can be any day within that month, not just on the first day of the month.
