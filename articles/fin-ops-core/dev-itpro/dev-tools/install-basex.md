# Install BaseX for Application Checker

[!include [banner](../includes/banner.md)]

[!include [banner](../includes/preview-banner.md)]

Application Checker depends on an installation of BaseX to store and query abstract syntax trees that the X++ compiler generates. This topic explains how to install and set up BaseX in a developer environment.

The sections of this topic should be completed in the order that they appear in.

If you're working in a developer environment and don't have admin privileges, use the tabs to switch to the instructions for non-admin users.

## Prerequisites

BaseX is a Java-based XML document database. It requires a Java Runtime Environment (JRE) of version 8 or later. Before you install BaseX, verify that a JRE is installed.

# [Admin: Install Java](#tab/admin)

Download and install Java JRE **64-bit** from the [Java download page](https://aka.ms/getjava).

# [Non-admin: Set up Java](#tab/non-admin)

Download Java **Server JRE** from the [Java download page](https://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html).

Java Server JRE is downloaded as a .tar.gz compressed archive that you must extract by using a tool such as [7zip](https://www.7-zip.org/download.html). You can download 7zip, without having to install it, from [SourceForge](https://sourceforge.net/projects/sevenzip/files/7-Zip/9.20/7za920.zip/download).

To extract Java Server JRE binaries from the archive, run the following Windows PowerShell commands.

> [!NOTE]
> You must modify these commands so that they reflect the version of the Server JRE archive that you downloaded. In the commands that are shown here, both 7za.exe and the archive are in the current working directory.

```powershell
.\7za.exe x .\server-jre-8u202-windows-x64.tar.gz # decompresses to current working directory
.\7za.exe x .\server-jre-8u202-windows-x64.tar # extracts jdk1.8.0_202 to current working directory
```

After you extract Java, modify and run the following Windows PowerShell script to add the Java bin folder to your **PATH** environment variable.

```powershell
[Environment]::SetEnvironmentVariable(
    "Path",
    # replace <path_to_jdk> below with the absolute path from the extracted jdk above
    [Environment]::GetEnvironmentVariable("Path", [EnvironmentVariableTarget]::User) + ";<path_to_jdk>\bin\",
    [EnvironmentVariableTarget]::User)
```

## Download BaseX

To download BaseX, go to the [BaseX website](http://basex.org/download/), and download the latest version.

# [Admin: Download BaseX](#tab/admin)

Download the Microsoft Windows installer from the download page.

# [Non-admin: Download BaseX](#tab/non-admin)

Download the zip package from the download page.

---

## Install BaseX

# [Admin: Install BaseX](#tab/admin)

Run the executable file on the developer machine where you will compile your module. For each step, accept the default settings.

# [Non-admin: Set up BaseX](#tab/non-admin)

Extract the BaseX zip package that you previously downloaded.

---

> [!TIP]
> If the installation drive doesn't have enough space for your model, you can change the folder for BaseX data later. For more information, see [BaseX configuration](http://docs.basex.org/wiki/Configuration#Database_Directory).

After you install BaseX, modify and run the following Windows PowerShell script to add the BaseX bin folder to your **PATH** environment variable.

```powershell
[Environment]::SetEnvironmentVariable(
    "Path",
    # replace <path_to_basex> below with the absolute path from the extracted basex zip package above
    [Environment]::GetEnvironmentVariable("Path", [EnvironmentVariableTarget]::User) + ";<path_to_basex>\bin\",
    [EnvironmentVariableTarget]::User)
```

> [!IMPORTANT]
> If Microsoft Visual Studio was open while you set the **PATH** environment variable, you must restart it.

## Configure BaseX to handle your model

Depending on the size of your model, BaseX can use a lot of memory.

By default, BaseX is configured to use a maximum of about 1200 megabytes (MB) of random-access memory (RAM). If you have a large model, you should consider increasing this limit by following these steps.

1. Open the batch script at **\<BaseX Install Path\>\\bin\\basex.bat** for editing.
2. Find the line that contains **set BASEX\_JVM=-Xmx1200m %BASEX\_JVM%**, and increase the value after **-Xmx**. For example, change the value to **10g** to let BaseX use up to 10 GB of RAM.

    For more information, see [Non-Standard Options](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/technotes/tools/windows/java.html#BABHDABI). This section of the Java documentation explains how to increase the limits of the Java virtual machine (VM).

    Leave the rest of the script unchanged.

> [!NOTE]
> You don't have to start the BaseX server, because Application Checker will use the standalone executable file for storage and queries.
